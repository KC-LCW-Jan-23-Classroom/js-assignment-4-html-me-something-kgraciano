      <h1>Our trip to New York City</h1>
      <p>In July of 2022, my boyfriend surprised me with a short trip to New York City, New York. Although we were only
         there for four days, we had a fun experience. We all know how expensive it is to go visit NYC so, for most of
         trip we just walked and observed and I had the best time there. I now get to say I saw my first huge rat at the
         subway and it was terrifying! It was like I was in a different world. I've never been anywhere close to New
         York so, I am greatful I had the oppurtunity to go.

            <h2>My willa</h2>
            <p>Meet my world, Willa. Unforturnatly, she was not allowed to particpate in this spur-of-the-moment
               adventure to NYC. Instead, she will be staying with grandma! Willa loves her grandma's house so we easily
               compromised. The reason why I am telling you about this because, grandma lives 3 and a half hours from
               KCI. Like the good parents we are, we sacrificed our sleep to head to grandmas the night of our flight.
               Our flight is at 6AM. Yikes!</p>

            <h3>KCI International Airpot</h3>
            <p>We arrived at Kansas&nbsp;City&nbsp;International&nbsp;Airport at 4AM. Perfect timing. We were rushed and
               yelled at by
               TSA, like always. With just one hour to spare we made it! At this point, we were <b>TIRED</b> but
               excited. We were both ready to roam the streets of NYC! </p>

            <h4>Welcome to New York City</h4>
            <p>Countless of people walking the streets New York City. I typically do not enjoy large crowds but, I
               found it admiriable just to watch people. Not to sound like a creep, I just find it interesting how
               different and unique people can be. The huge lit up billboards definitely captured my attention and was
               exactly how I imagined them to be. And Yes, Time Square has a unique smell to it not very flattering. You
               would eventually know when and where to hold your breath and cover your nose! </p>

            <h5>The best tacos ever</h5>
            <p>Although we didn't have a chance to eat at pricey high end, top notch, NYC's best restaurants, we did
               find a gem. Los&nbsp;Tacos&nbsp;No.1. I fell inlove after one bite. They make the tacos right infront of
               you and it's cool to watch how fast they can be. I had the best experience there and the service was
               great!.
               A long line out through the entrance everytime we visited, but for sure worth it. I recommended this
               place if you love tacos like me! Add this to your list when you plan to visit NYC! Visit their webiste<a
                  href="https://www.lostacos1.com/menus/" target="_blank"> here </a>and view the delicious menu!</p>

            <footer>Fun fact: This place makes their own tortillas! Yum!</footer>

            <h6>Manhattan and me</h6>
            <p>Since we were in NYC for only four days, we didnt have the chance to explore enough but it was much
               needed. We all deserve a little get away every once in a while. I appreciate my boyfriend for this little
               getaway. Can't wait to have many more! </p>
